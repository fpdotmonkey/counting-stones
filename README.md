# Counting Stones

A little counting game where you place stones onto a board such that the sum of
all surrounding stones is equal to the value of the stone you placed.

Click on a square to place a stone there, right click to undo a move, and press
`N` or `P` to play different boards.

This game is based on the one shown in the Numberphile video
["Stones on an Infinite Chessboard"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Uth-EaTZ8).

To build the game, open it up in [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org/download) and
export the project.
